    <section id="constitutional" style="margin-top: 70px; text-align: justify;">
      <h2>Constitutional and Administrative Law</h2>
      <p>The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950 is the lengthiest written constitution in
        the world. Although its administrative provisions are to a large extent based on the Government of India Act
        1935, it also contains various other provisions that were drawn from other constitutions in the world at the
        time of its creation.It provides details of the administration of both the Union and the States, and codifies
        the relations between the Federal Government and the State Governments.Also incorporated into the text are a
        chapter on the fundamental rights of citizens, as well as a chapter on directive principles of state policy.

        The constitution prescribes a federal structure of government, with a clearly defined separation of legislative
        and executive powers between the Federation and the States.Each State Government has the freedom to draft its
        own laws on subjects classified as state subjects.Laws passed by the Parliament of India and other pre-existing
        central laws on subjects classified as central subjects are binding on all citizens. However, the Constitution
        also has certain unitary features, such as vesting power of amendment solely in the Federal Government,the
        absence of dual citizenship,and the overriding authority assumed by the Federal Government in times of
        emergency.</p>

    <section id="Criminal" style="margin-top: 70px; text-align: justify;">
      <h2>Criminal Law</h2>
      <p>The Indian Penal Code formulated by the British during the British Raj in 1860, forms the backbone of criminal
        law in India. The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 governs the procedural aspects of the criminal law.

        Jury trials were abolished by the government in 1960 on the grounds they would be susceptible to media and
        public influence. This decision was based on an 8-1 acquittal of Kawas Nanavati in K. M. Nanavati vs. State of
        Maharashtra, which was overturned by higher courts.

        In February 2011, the Supreme Court of India ruled that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to
        counsel.

        Capital punishment in India is legal. Renuka Shinde and Seema Mohan Gavit, who were guilty of kidnapping and
        killing at least 13 children under 6 years, are currently lodged in Yerwada Central Jail. They were also the
        first women in India to be given capital punishment. The last execution was conducted on 20 March 2020, where
        the death sentence was awarded to the convicts—Pawan Gupta, Akshay Singh Thakur, Vinay Sharma, and Mukesh
        Singh—by a trial court, a decision which was upheld by Delhi High Court and Supreme Court as well.</p>

    <section id="Contract" style="margin-top: 70px; text-align: justify;">
      <h2>Contract Law</h2>
      <p>The main contract law in India is codified in the Indian Contract Act, which came into effect on 1 September
        1872 and extends to all India. It governs entrance into contract, and effects of breach of contract. Indian
        Contract law is popularly known as mercantile law of India. Originally Indian Sales of Goods Act and Partnership
        Act were part of Indian Contract act, but due to needed amendment these acts were separated from Contract Act.
        The Contract act occupies the most important place in legal agreements in India.</p>

    <section id="Labor" style="margin-top: 70px; text-align: justify;">
      <h2>Labor Law</h2>
      <p>Indian labour law are among the most comprehensive in the world. They have been criticised by the World
        Bank,primarily on the grounds of the inflexibility that results from government needing to approve dismissals.
        In practice, there is a large informal sector of workers, between 80 or 90 per cent of the labour force, to whom
        labour rights are not actually available and laws are not enforced.</p>

    <section id="Tort" style="margin-top: 70px; text-align: justify;">
      <h2>Tort Law</h2>
      <p>Tort law in India is primarily governed by judicial precedent as in other common law jurisdictions,
        supplemented by statutes governing damages, civil procedure, and codifying common law torts. As in other common
        law jurisdictions, a tort is breach of a non-contractual duty which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving
        rise to a civil cause of action and for which remedy is available. If a remedy does not exist, a tort has not
        been committed since the rationale of tort law is to provide a remedy to the person who has been wronged.

        While Indian tort law is generally derived from English law, there are certain differences between the two
        systems. Indian tort law uniquely includes remedies for constitutional torts, which are actions by the
        government that infringe upon rights enshrined in the Constitution, as well as a system of absolute liability
        for businesses engaged in hazardous activity.

        As tort law is similar in nature across common law jurisdictions, courts have readily referred to case law from
        other common law jurisdictions such as the UK,Australia, and Canada in addition to domestic precedent. However,
        attention is given to local norms and conditions, as well as India's distinct constitutional framework in
        applying foreign precedent. The legislature have also created statutes to provide for certain social conditions.
        Similar to other common law countries, aspects of tort law have been codified.

        Certain conduct which gives rise to a cause of action under tort law is additionally criminalised by the Indian
        Penal Code or other criminal legislation. Where a tort also constitutes a criminal offence, its prosecution by
        the state does not preclude the aggrieved party from seeking a remedy under tort law. The overlap between the
        two areas of law is a result of the distinct purposes each serves and the nature of the remedies each provides.
        Tort law aims to hold a tortfeasor accountable and consequently tort actions are brought directly by the
        aggrieved party in order to seek damages, whereas criminal law aims to punish and deter conduct deemed to be
        against the interests of society and criminal actions are thus brought by the state and penalties include
        imprisonment, fines, or execution.

        In India, as in the majority of common law jurisdictions, the standard of proof in tort cases is the balance of
        probabilities as opposed to the reasonable doubt standard used in criminal cases or the preponderance of the
        evidence standard used in American tort litigation, although the latter is extremely similar in practice to the
        balance of probabilities standard. Similar to the constitutional presumption of innocence in Indian criminal
        law, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in tort actions in India. India, like the majority of common law
        jurisdictions in Asia and Africa, does not permit the use of juries in civil or criminal trials, in direct
        contrast to America and the Canadian common law provinces which retain civil juries as well as to jurisdictions
        like England and Wales or New Zealand which permit juries in a limited set of tort actions.</p>

    <section id="Tax" style="margin-top: 70px; text-align: justify;">
      <h2>Tax Law</h2>
      <p>Indian tax law involves several different taxes levied by different governments. Income Tax is levied by the
        Central Government under the Income Tax Act 1961. Customs and excise duties are also levied by the Central
        government. Sales tax is levied under VAT legislation at the state level. Since a new tax reform in the form of
        GST was levied through constitutional amendment and came into existence since 1 July 2017 which took the place
        of excise duties and VAT.

        The authority to levy a tax is derived from the Constitution of India which allocates the power to levy various
        taxes between the Centre and the State. An important restriction on this power is Article 265 of the
        Constitution which states that "No tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law." Therefore,
        each tax levied or collected has to be backed by an accompanying law, passed either by the Parliament or the
        State Legislature. In 2010-11, the gross tax collection amounted to ₹ 7.92 billion (Long scale), with direct tax
        and indirect tax contributing 56% and 44% respectively.</p>
